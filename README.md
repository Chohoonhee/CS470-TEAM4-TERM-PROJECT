# CS470-TEAM4-TERM-PROJECT
It is a model that predicts the trajectory of the Vehicle by using deep learning. 


![Model Diagram](model_figure.png)

We used Attention, LSTM, etc. to solve various problems of existing MTP. The path is generated for all the agents on the image, not for one agent. 

## Directory Setting
![Directory](Directory_Setting.png) ![Experiment](Experiment_Directory.png) ![Data](Data_Directory.png)
If the train or test (visualization) is to be carried out smoothly, the form of the directory should be as shown in the figure above.
When the git was first clone, there would not be an experiment and data folder, which was uploaded separately using drive because of its large capacity.
It is important to note that the data folder should be unzip so that there is no additional data folder in the data folder.

## Dataset


You can download dataset through link.
We recommend using the dataset we provide because we used the nuscene dataset by processing.


## Trained Model

Because the trained model also has a large capacity, you need to download it through drive link.
If you unzip just like the directory picture, it will work without any problems.


## Training

python3 main.py



## Testing

python3 test_visualize.py
